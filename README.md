TestStaticLibraryCocoaPods
==========================

Test static library project that has problem with using CocoaPods dependencies

Very simple example where static library has problems using CocoaPods.

There are 2 unit tests written to present this odd behaviour.

When using AFNetworking method, test don't compile at all,
When using Typhoon test crash at runtime.
